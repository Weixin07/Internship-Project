aboutTitle : "About",
aboutText : "A very useful method of determining a baby's well-being in the womb is by monitoring the fetal movements. Timely intervention after a mother complained of decreased fetal movements and the baby was found to be compromised on further evaluation had saved many a babies. Hence, most Obstetricians recommend mothers to monitor their babies' movements using the Fetal Kick Count.",
helpText : "The most widely used Fetal Kick Count is the Cardiff Count of Ten. It is used after 28 weeks of pregnancy till delivery. In the Conventional Count, you start recording the fetal kicks after 9.00 am daily. Once you have counted 10 kicks you record the time. If you are unable to get 10 kicks by 6.00 pm you should concentrate on the movements. By 9.00 pm, if you still have not obtained 10 fetal kicks you should seek the opinion of your Midwife or Obstetrician.",
